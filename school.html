    <h2>Everybody wants to go to heaven; but nobody wants to die for it!</h2>
     <p>India is a secular country with diverse languages, cultures and traditions. The people have lived in harmony with acceptance and tolerance for others since ages. They have fought for the freedom of our country together; they celebrate and mourn together, and help and assist each other whenever required. The constitution of our country guarantees equal rights, opportunities and wages to all citizens.</p><br><br>
    <p>Our is a capitalist society where a small percentage of the population controls the majority of wealth and resources. The rich are powerful and have an access to the world class facilities such as quality education for their children, unadulterated and organic food, the best in healthcare etc. On the other hand, the not so rich have food, shelter and daily sustenance as their priority. Their children may go to government schools or give them a helping hand in earning a livelihood for the family. Education, which is the most important tool that can empower people is not readily and easily available even after 71 years of independence and the majority of our children are deprived of quality education. According to Nelson Mandela, ‘Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.’ Education is the key to eliminate gender inequality, racism, superstitions, casteism, reduce poverty, create a sustainable planet, prevent illness and pointless deaths, and foster peace and harmony. Education is the most important investment for any country. But we as a country have not been able to achieve any of this despite education being the main focus of our policies.</p><br><Br>
        
    <p>Since our independence in 1947, the government has come up with a large number of schemes and plans for the steady and rapid progress of our country. India has progressed well; but not at the pace envisioned and according to the funds allocated. Our country is a victim of crony capitalism where politicians and rich contractors and businessmen scratch each other’s backs; the tenders, contracts and deals are allotted to crooked businessmen and politicians in order to get huge kickbacks. As a result, the poor and needy never benefit from the government schemes. The economically weaker sections of our country have the least probability of ever coming out of their pathetic state because they are unable to reap the benefits promised by the government. The entire system is corrupt and hence there is no check on the public facilities that are specially provided for the destitutes. The needy might have a ration card but ration shops do not provide them with rations as it has already been sold by the shopkeeper; teachers do not report for their duties in government schools and as a result children remain illiterate even after years of attending school; the police are reluctant to register crimes especially if committed by the rich and powerful; the public hospitals are ill equipped in terms of equipment, staff and medicines. The moral degeneration of our society has lead to self-centred and selfish individuals for whom individual interests are above the interests of our community, society and country.</p><br><br>
        
    <p>We are not disturbed by these issues as long as they are not pertinent to us. We are happy living in a corrupt setup, paying huge amounts for grocery and medical bills, saving each and every penny possible for our children’s higher education, and trying to sustain in an environment full of pollution. It is high time that we wake up and take corrective measures! As parents and teachers, we ought to be role models. In case each and every one of us decide to do our bit by saying no to bribes, keeping our environment clean by not contributing to the pollution, and doing our duties with utmost honesty and diligence, there is a possibility for a better future for our coming generations and that would diminish the divide between the classes and masses.  </p>
